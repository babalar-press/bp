    BABALAR PRESS is a Qazaq experimental research, writing and publishing initiative for relearning, reclaiming and reimagining 
    our ancestral knowledge(s).
    Through zines, workshops and research fellowships, BABALAR PRESS creates informal & caring spaces for us to engage with, 
    reinterpret & share the stories, knowledges and practices of our collective and personal babalar (qazaq for “ancestors”).

    We often say that our country is home to people of many different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. What is not voiced often 
    enough is how many of us, in all our differences – as a result of colonial rule by russian empire and soviet union, with their 
    politics of mass deportations, repressions, genocide and erasure of indigenous identities and peoples – bear the shared trauma 
    of being cut off from the worlds, knowledges, languages and practices of our ancestors.
    At BABALAR PRESS, we believe that the task of healing these wounds is crucial to our individual and collective wellbeing, 
    and we approach this task through active reconnection with our ancestral worlds. Through critical and creative research and 
    personal meaning-making in dialogue with our ancestral knowledges, we hope to reclaim ownership over those knowledges, keep them 
    useful and alive, remember who we were and are, and imagine who we want to be.

      had to dream up. The main audience of BABALAR PRESS are people like ourselves and our collaborators: Qazaq people, of
      diverse ethnic, linguistic and social backgrounds, on their personal journeys of remembering and reclaiming their
      ancestral heritage and cultural identity.</div></div></div>

      <div class="bg-white shadow-2xl shadow-white rounded-xl p-2 font-sans-serif sm:text-4xl md:text-4xl lg:text-2xl text-brown">2. We believe that, in order to come into full ownership of our ancestral knowledges – to once again embody, practice and
      shape them – more Qazaq people must have opportunities to “spend time” with those knowledges, to explore and experiment with them.
      Moreover, in our opinion, the participation and leadership of Qazaq people from marginalized groups in the meaning-making
      around our ancestral knowledges is crucial, if we are to shape a future Qazaq society that includes us all. We see women, 
      non-binary and LGBTQIA people, representatives of ethnic minorities, qandastar and other Qazaq people, who have been/are excluded 
      from or not supported in their knowledge production around this topic, as the main authors of BABALAR PRESS.</div>

        Through BABALAR PRESS, we want to create a space for our Qazaq voices, stories, and experiences.
        For the voices of our near and far, shared and personal ancestors. For training our voice muscles.
        For realizing and celebrating the value, beauty and power of our voices and stories.
        For experimenting with, documenting and sharing our voices.

        BABALAR PRESS is a learning community – we believe that we all have something to teach and learn from one another.
        BABALAR PRESS is also a community of learners – this is our first attempt at creating such a space, we are driven by intuition,
        learning and figuring things out as we go, and accepting-welcoming that mistakes/change/growth will be part of our journey.

        As we & people around us learn and reconnect to our ancestral worlds, we are practicing extending kindness to ourselves
        and one another, and hope you, dear reader and/or potential collaborator, will do the same.

        We hope BABALAR PRESS will be an opportunity for us, with our many identities, languages and experiences, to break 
        out of our "bubbles" and come into generative and mutually supportive dialogue.

        We aspire to create projects which serve as an intersection for such people, where authors can express themselves
        and share knowledge in a language and format that suits them, and where they can be heard by “speakers” of other languages.</div>

        BABALAR PRESS is a multilingual space. Our forthcoming events, publications & social media posts will all be in Qazaq, 
        Russian and English. 

        At the same time our team believes in the importance of transitioning to Qazaq as a language that will be spoken and
        shared by all people within our country, alongside any other languages they may speak. Some members of our community are
        learning Qazaq language right now, and we invite you all to join us at the time & speed that feels right for you.
